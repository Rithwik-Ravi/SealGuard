# 🛡️ SealGuard: AI-Powered Transformer Leak Monitor

**SealGuard** is an AI-driven monitoring system designed to detect moisture ingress and air leaks in oil-filled power transformers. By analyzing the relationship between **Oil Temperature** (breathing) and **Silica Gel Breather Bubbles**, the system uses an Isolation Forest algorithm to identify anomalies in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-Time Simulation:** Simulates realistic transformer heating and cooling cycles using a virtual ESP32.
* **AI Anomaly Detection:** Uses an **Isolation Forest** (Machine Learning) model to detect leaks.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with **Streamlit** to visualize live telemetry data.
* **Dual-Axis Telemetry:** Tracks Temperature vs. Bubble Count on a synchronized timeline.
* **Smart Guardrails:** Hybrid logic (AI + Rules) ensures zero false alarms during heating cycles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Dashboard:** Streamlit
* **ML Model:** Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest)
* **Visualization:** Altair
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Simulation:** Custom Python Physics Engine (`fake_esp.py`)
